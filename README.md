## Installation

To try **QR Code Here** yourself, either get it directly from the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/sa/app/qr-code-here/id1577042983?mt=12) or download the code and build it through Xcode. Itâ€™s built using SwiftUI, so youâ€™ll need macOS Big Sur in order to run it. 

**Warning:** SwiftUI on macOS is a little flaky at times, so I highly recommend you update to the very latest macOS version if you want to avoid any surprises.



## Contribution guide

Any help you can offer with this project is most welcome â€“ there are opportunities big and small so that someone with only a small amount of Swift experience can help.

Some suggestions you might want to explore:

- Adding support to change the QR code look.
- Addng support to add a logo inside the QR code.
- Adding support to change the font.
- Adding support for [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint).
- Add documentation in the code or here in the README.
- Did I mention handling errors in a meaningful way?

Youâ€™re also welcome to try adding some tests, although given our underlying use of `CIFilter` that might be tricky.

If you spot any errors please open an issue and let us know which macOS and Xcode versions youâ€™re using.
